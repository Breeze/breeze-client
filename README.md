# breeze-client
Breeze data management for JavaScript clients.  
See the [docs](http://breeze.github.io/doc-js/features.html) for more info about what Breeze does and how to use it.

## Build using ng-packagr
Run `npm run build`.  This will create files in the '\dist' dir.  The directory structure is the [Angular Package Format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZC2rcpxffTDfRDs6p1cfbmKNLA6x5O-NtkJglDaBVs/preview).

    adapter-*/                Breeze adapter definitions (*.d.ts) for ajax, data service, model library, and uri builder
    bundles/                  Breeze and adapter libraries in UMD
    esm5/                     Breeze and adapter libraries as ES5 modules (separate source files)
    esm2015/                  Breeze and adapter libraries as ES6 modules (separate source files)
    fesm5/                    Breeze and adapter libraries as ES5 modules (combined source files)
    fesm2015/                 Breeze and adapter libraries as ES6 modules (combined source files)
    spec/                     TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) for tests
    src/                      TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) for source
    breeze-client.d.ts        TypeScript definition file (links to the files in src/) 
    breeze-client.metadata.json      Metadata for Angular AOT
    index.d.ts                Main entry point
    LICENSE                   MIT
    package.json              Package metadata
    public_api.d.ts           Main entry point


It will also create `breeze-client-{version}.tgz` in the main directory.  This file can then be installed in a project using

    npm install ..\{path}\breeze-client-{version}.tgz


## Build API Docs
Run `npm run typedoc`.  This will create a '\docs' dir. click on the 'index.html' in this folder to see the docs.

## Breaking Changes
API is almost identical to the original (breezejs 1.x) but small changes are noted below:

 - Breeze no longer depends upon Q.js.  But it does depend on a ES6 promise implementation. i.e. the existence of a global `Promise` object.  The `setQ` function is now a no-op.
 - The names of the enum values no longer have "Symbol" at the end.  E.g. `EntityStateSymbol` is now `EntityState`.
 - The `DataServiceOptions` interface is now `DataServiceConfig` to be consistent with other naming
 - The `initializeAdapterInstances` method is removed; use the singular `config.initializeAdapterInstance` method.

 ### Adapter Changes
 The names of the adapter files have changed.  E.g. `breeze.dataService.webApi` is now `adapter-data-service-webapi`, 
 and the locations have changed due to Angular-compatible bundling.

If you have this:

    import 'breeze-client/breeze.dataService.webApi';
    import 'breeze-client/breeze.modelLibrary.backingStore';
    import 'breeze-client/breeze.uriBuilder.odata';

Replace it with this for ES5 (Angular 2 - 7):

    import 'breeze-client/esm5/adapter-data-service-webapi/adapter-data-service-webapi';
    import 'breeze-client/esm5/adapter-model-library-backing-store/adapter-model-library-backing-store';
    import 'breeze-client/esm5/adapter-uri-builder-json/adapter-uri-builder-json';

Or this for ES6 (Angular 8+):

    import 'breeze-client/esm2015/adapter-data-service-webapi/adapter-data-service-webapi';
    import 'breeze-client/esm2015/adapter-model-library-backing-store/adapter-model-library-backing-store';
    import 'breeze-client/esm2015/adapter-uri-builder-json/adapter-uri-builder-json';

And the UMD versions are still available (under the `bundles` directory) for apps that use global JavaScript libraries:

    <script src="node_modules/breeze-client/bundles/breeze-client.umd.js"></script>
    <script src="node_modules/breeze-client/bundles/breeze-client-adapter-model-library-backing-store.umd.js"></script>
    <script src="node_modules/breeze-client/bundles/breeze-client-adapter-data-service-webapi.umd.js"></script>
    <script src="node_modules/breeze-client/bundles/breeze-client-adapter-ajax-angularjs.umd.js"></script>

## Compile Notes
In general we have avoided using null parameters in favor of undefined parameters thoughout the API. This means that signatures will look like

a(p1: string, p2?: Entity)

as opposed to 

a(p1: string, p2?: Entity | null);

This IS deliberate.  In general, with very few exceptions input parameters will rarely say 'p: x | null'.  The only exceptions are where
we need to be able to pass a null parameter followed by one or more non null params.  This is very rare. SaveEntities(entities: Entity[] | null, ...)
is one exception. 

Note that this is not a breaking change because the underlying code will always check for either a null or undefined. i.e. 'if (p2 == null) {'
so this convention only affects typescript consumers of the api.  Pure javascript users can still pass a null in ( if they want to)

Note that it is still acceptable for api calls to return a null to indicate that nothing was found.  i.e. like getEntityType().  

## Jasmine tests 

1) from command line
    run 'npm install jasmine -g' ( global install).
    run 'jasmine'  from top level breeze-next dir.

2) from vs code debugger
    add this section to 'launch.json'
     
        {
            "name": "Debug Jasime Tests",
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/jasmine/bin/jasmine.js",
            "stopOnEntry": false,
            "args": [
               
            ],
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "sourceMaps": true,
            "outDir": "${workspaceRoot}/dist"
        }    

    run 'npm install jasmine' // local install   
    set breakpoint and hit Ctrl-F5.
