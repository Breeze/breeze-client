# [Breeze](http://breeze.github.io/doc-main/) Data Management for JavaScript Clients  

**Breeze** is a library that helps you manage data in rich client applications. If you store data in a database, query and save those data as complex object graphs, and share these graphs across multiple screens of your JavaScript client, Breeze is for you.

Client-side querying, caching, dynamic object graphs, change tracking and notification, model validation, batch save, offline â€¦ all part of rich data management with Breeze.  Breeze clients communicate with any remote service that speaks HTTP and JSON.

**Breeze** lets you develop applications using the same powerful idioms on the client and server. You can

- query with a rich query syntax
- navigate the graph of related entities
- track changes as you add/change/delete entities
- perform client-side validation
- save all changes in a single transaction
- use the same entity model on the server and client
