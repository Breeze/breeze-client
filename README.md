# [Breeze](http://breeze.github.io/doc-main/) Data Management for JavaScript Clients  

**Breeze** is a library that helps you manage data in rich client applications. If you store data in a database, query and save those data as complex object graphs, and share these graphs across multiple screens of your JavaScript client, Breeze is for you.

Client-side querying, caching, dynamic object graphs, change tracking and notification, model validation, batch save, offline â€¦ all part of rich data management with Breeze.  Breeze clients communicate with any remote service that speaks HTTP and JSON.

**Breeze** lets you develop applications using the same powerful idioms on the client and server. You can

- query with a rich query syntax
- navigate the graph of related entities
- track changes as you add/change/delete entities
- perform client-side validation
- save all changes in a single transaction
- use the same entity model on the server and client

## Install from npm

    npm install breeze-client
or 

    npm install breeze-client@cjs

The version tagged `cjs` uses an older Angular Package Format, and includes ES5 and ES2015 versions, as well as UMD bundles.

The version tagged `latest` (and `mjs`) uses updated [Angular Package Format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZC2rcpxffTDfRDs6p1cfbmKNLA6x5O-NtkJglDaBVs/preview) and ES2022 .mjs modules.  It has `esm2022` and `fesm2022` folders, but no UMD `bundles` folder.

If you want the latest module format, and don't care about UMD bundles, use `breeze-client`.

If you need UMD bundles, or need backward compatibility with ES5 or ES2015, use `breeze-client@cjs`.
